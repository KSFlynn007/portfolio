## Previous Version
https://github.com/KSFlynn007/old-portfolio-website

## Design Process 
I used Bootstrap for this portfolio website, as I knew that my portfolio will likely grow and change rapidly in a year, I wanted styling that could change quickly and responsively to new content inserted.
I also went with a primarily single-page look, as I wanted a user to get the information in a concise yet visually appealing way. In comparison, I found my first version was clunky, too many pages and clicks for non-vital information, and didn't look as good on mobile.
